 description: Every year over Christmas I have a crack at doing something completely out there myself. In 2020, my partner and I decided to try replacing our aging carpet with something much more modern and easier to clean. As it turns out, laminated plank flooring not only feels great underfoot, but also is surprisingly eco-friendly and stunning if you find the right supplier. All up it took me 4 days to transition and paint 15 square metres of our home.

## What is Laminate Flooring?

Over Christmas in 2020, I thought I'd tackle our aging carpet and see if I could find a way to replace it with something that was both affordable, looked better and made cleaning and maintenance easier. [Laminate flooring](https://www.floormania.com.au/laminate-flooring-vs-vinyl-planks/) is made from composite wood that is pressed together at high temperatures [[1]](https://www.carpetcall.com.au/blog/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-laminate-flooring/) to create a synthetic wood plank with an embedded locking mechanism for easy installation. Laminate flooring is typically quite affordable, ranging from [AUD $14](https://www.bunnings.com.au/hanwood-home-7mm-2-87sqm-chinchilla-oak-laminate-flooring_p0135640) for more simplistic wooden appearances up to [AUD $51](https://www.bunnings.com.au/laminate-floor-tarkett-10mm-soundlogic-victoria-oak-tabac-1-74sqm_p0176071) for more realistic grain and texture.

### Affordability

Laminate flooring is typically much more affordable compared to other flooring such as timber or even carpet. Timber flooring can range in price from AUD $50 for imperfect, poorer cuts of wood through to AUD $150 for higher quality cuts with fewer defects [[2]](https://hipages.com.au/article/how_much_does_hardwood_timber_flooring_cost). Carpet alone can cost upwards of AUD $60 for supplies excluding installation, which can be tricky to get right hence my recommendation to get it run for you [[3]](https://hipages.com.au/article/how_much_does_carpet_laying_cost). 

Excluding the time of installation, laminate flooring was a really convincing option for us in the high traffic spaces of our home, such as the hallway and the office, due to the affordability factor alone. 

### Ease of installation

Laminate flooring uses a simple locking mechanism, as shown above [[4]](https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/OkWTdU-Fooy3xxbXlfUJj_0JlEM=/2848x2136/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Installing-Laminate-How-Locking-Mechanism-Works-56a49e423df78cf772834b19.JPG), which makes crafting seamless joins between each plank very straightforward. The most challenging aspect of the installation is usually door spaces and corners which demand more precise cuts using either a jig- or table- saw in my case. Ease of installation in contrast to traditional timber or carpet, however, is leaps and bounds ahead as the planks are provided in boxes of specified area which makes calculating required supplies a breeze.

### Environmental impact

Lastly, laminate flooring has a really positive impact on the environment both due to the [manufacturing process](https://www.eplf.com/en/laminate-made-europe/environment-ecology) but also due to it's longevity when installed into a home, lasting upwards of [20 years](https://www.coswick.com/blog/deciding-between-hardwood-and-laminate-flooring-which-is-better/). The products are also able to be easily recycled using [thermal cycling](https://www.woodsolutions.com.au/articles/recycling-and-wood-waste). Although much of the planks themselves are able to be converted back into chips, which can then be used for manufacturing [new planks](https://www.eplf.com/en/laminate-made-europe/environment-ecology).

## The nitty gritty

### Getting started

My partner and I nominated for a lighter wood appearance, since we found the hallway and the office were both already dark spaces; and darker floors would make the space feel even less inviting than it already was. You can see above how our carpet was dated and had started to accumulate stains (thanks to our puppy) that we were failing to clear out. 

### Removing the carpet

The process of removing the carpet was relatively straightforward, and as it turns out, the hardest part was removing the carpet nail boards whch required a crowbar. The next few phases involved vacuuming and clearing the concrete base from loose debris which could cause crunching when the new floor was placed over it.

### Removing the skirting (optional)

I nominated to removing the skirting board as well, since typically you would need quarter seam when installing the floor and I found elevating the skirting would give us a more seamless appearance. This process required a chisel, a crowbar and some faith. The process was absolutely terrifying at first since we've never done something quite as extreme as ripping off anything from our walls. But I found some [great videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2hnazXzUT8) which made me realise that, worst case scenario, you just move home.

### The fun part

The actually process of laying down the planks was the most straightforward and least terrifying experience. There's [some](https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/flooring/laminate-and-vinyl/how-to-lay-laminate-flooring) [great](https://parryscarpets.com.au/laminate/the-ultimate-guide-to-installing-laminate-flooring-yourself/) [guides](https://www.tilewizards.com.au/insider-tips-for-laying-laminate-floor/) out there that really helped me through the process of cutting and aligning the planks to position. Ensure you follow the guidance provided with your specific floor type as locking mechanisms vary between laminate flooring types.

### The result

Once the planks were laid, I restored the skirting, painted the walls using [Hampton's Blue](https://shop.porterspaints.com/paint/trim/hamptons-blue), and restored the paintings to the wall and called it a week. The office took a further few days to finish, but I found that larger areas were easier to finish than smaller more compact areas, since there were less cuts of wood needed. If I had a table saw it definitely would have sped this process up significantly.

## Closing remarks

The entire process, in hindsight, was really rewarding. I both got some Christmas exercise moving by lifting planks here and there, but also had the rewarding sense of accomplishment of following a task to completion over my Christmas break. My suggestion is to ensure you have the right equipment, even though it may be a bit expensive at first. All up, including equipment, this particular task cost under **AUD $1000** to cover two rooms. Although, next time I do another room (which will be midway through 2021), I'll have both the gear and confidence now to tackle my next carpet replacement. 

The hardest part of this task was getting started and overcoming the fear of messing up my home. All I can say is, worst case scenario, there are always professional tradesmen who can tidy up mistakes. This task comes with minimal risk of permanent damage that can't be fixed, beyond getting a floor you've already ripped up professionally installed. Would I do it again? Yep, I'll be back doing another room in six months.
