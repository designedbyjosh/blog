<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is my eighth attempt at making a blog, so instead of making "another blog", this time things are different and I'm going to call it my web "house". The last few attempts at this, I just couldn't accept that things weren't perfect and that there were lines of code and design decisions that were just damn awful. Since then, I've learned a great deal about web security, how to design things and how to make things pretty(er?).

This project is mostly about me learning how to do things and having a traceable archive of my previous projects so I can remember my mistakes and how not to repeat them.

### Why a House?
I felt constrained because a blog has to have articles, and I don't really write articles, I just play and make things. A house has lots of different objects in it ranging from your garbage through to your prized possessions, this is meant to resemble that.

### Why won't it fail this time?
I've learned so much about how to design things and I've had a number of professional projects between the last time I attempted this and my current attempt. So here we are, back again, and this time I'm doing it not with the intention of perfecting it, but with the intention of having a dedicated space to showcase my portfolio of work.
